## Tutorial on howm package
This tutorial is for people who:
1. Want to develop an efficient note-taking system that can effectively manage incoming information and internal thought flow.
2. Intend to use Emacs for this purpose.
3. Are not satisfied with popular solutions like org-roam.

I'm sure that typos, spelling errors, stylistic inaccuracies, and semantic inconsistencies may have crept into the text. If you notice anything from this list, please let me know. I've created a special form for the sake of privacy.

Send edits ☞ [here](https://forms.gle/AECEhwNjhzU57you7). I cannot guarantee fast edits, but I will make some revisions to the text, so please stay tuned.

The instructions provided in this manual are valid for the howm version 1.5.1
