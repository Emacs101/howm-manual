## Tutorial on howm package
This project is dedicated to people who use writing to make sense of the world. We need a tool to assemble pieces of information and interlink scattered facts.
Howm—an Emacs package created by Kazuyuki Hiraoka—seems well-suited for this task. It functions as a personal wiki. As the Howm motto says, you can “write fragmentally and read collectively.”

While it’s possible to master Howm on your own if you’re familiar with Emacs, having a tutorial is always helpful. So here it is.
You can download the book Efficient Note-taking in Emacs with Howm in either the [ePUB](Howm_tutorial_eng.epub) or [PDF](Howm_tutorial_eng.pdf) format.

As a side note, it’s easier to do that from the page on my [website](https://emacs101.github.io).

The instructions in this tutorial apply to Howm version 1.5.5.
